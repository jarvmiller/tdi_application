Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes I hadnt met yet running around all summer getting into trouble It turned out it would be me and just one girl Thats you

like you and you like me and I morethanlike you But I dont know if you do or dont morethanlike me Youve never said so I havent been saying anything all summer Content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me And choosing to do so again the next day and so on A girl whos smart and funny and who if I say something dumb for a laugh Is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh But who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be A girl who reads books that no ones assigned to her Whose curly brown hair has a line running through it From where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet Back in the real world we dont go to the same school And unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood We wont go to the same high school So this is kind of it for us Unless I say something And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something The suns gone down and the bus is quiet A lot of kids are asleep Were talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop That looks like a kid we know And then Im like Can I tell you something And all of a sudden Im telling you And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming And your face is there and gone and there and gone As we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway And theres no expression on it And I think just after a point Im just talking to lengthen the time Where we live in a world where you havent said yes or no yet And regrettably I end up using the word destiny I dont remember in what context Doesnt really matter Before long Im out of stuff to say and you smile and say okay I dont know exactly what you mean by it but it seems vaguely positive And I would leave in order not to spoil the moment But theres nowhere to go because were are on a bus So I pretend like Im asleep and before long I really am I wake up the bus isnt moving anymore The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on I turn and youre not there Then again a lot of kids arent in their seats anymore Were parked at the pickup point which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church The bus is half empty You might be in your dads car by now Your bags and things piled high in the trunk The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time Disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus Just as one of them reaches my row It used to be our row on our way off Its Michelle a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week After throwing rocks at my head Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors bodywise She stops and looks down at me And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light so I cant really see her face But I can see her smile And she says one word destiny Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh And then she turns and leads them off the bus I didnt know you were friends with them I find my dad in the parking lot He drives me back to our house and camp is over So is summer even though theres two weeks until school starts This isnt a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad This is a story about how I learned something and Im not saying this thing is true or not Im just saying its what I learned I told you something It was just for you and you told everybody So I learned cut out the middle man make it all for everybody always Everybody cant turn around and tell everybody everybody already knows I told them But this means there isnt a place in my life for you or someone like you Is it sad Sure But its a sadness I chose I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy And got off a man more cynical hardened and mature and shit But thats not

going on but I stick to the ones I love I never claimed to be a perfect man but name a great man who was Consequences of my actions in the past years had me stressing out It was like May I just moved to LA I was tryna figure it out Medication for depression that I cut cold turkey had the kid manic In an episode out in Hollywood wilding out like Nick Cannon Railing Adderall pills out a dollar bill on the bathroom floor Clean the whole mess up with my nose what the fuck I need a vacuum for New York City on my birthday June 6th 2014 I had that first meeting with Hov plus I brought out the whole team I drank that whole bottle of Dusse Ty Ty gave me that night When we left the club at the Rap Genius house me and shorty got into a fight She came out the room swingin hit me in the jaw I was really tryna fend her off But I ended up in the closet with my hands around her neck I was tripping dawg Too proud to apologize or empathize I blamed it all on her Saying that she hit me first even though she was the one hurt I was really just reflecting all the hurt that I was feeling from the bands rejection When Kids These Days split that shit felt like a csection And my infidelity and jealousy with Natalie on top of the amphetamines And the ecstasy had me tryna drown face down in the Chesapeake The next month I dropped Down on My Luck and had Europe going nuts But I couldnt even appreciate it at the time I was going through too much Now I had to leverage million dollar label deals on the table for my records In Ibiza eating paella on the roof tryna choose over breakfast Hov wasnt with the bidding war but I knew the Roc just felt right When I saw Kanye at Wireless without TPain still a good life Felt so close when Mr Hudson introduced me to him backstage He prolly dont even remember that shit like a bitch off Backpage But at that stage I was ready to swing for the fence like a batting cage At the same time I was winding down a low point in my addict phase The Adderall started wearing off and I went into a deep writers block All over a song that I couldnt finish that I wrote about signin to the Roc Isnt that ironic I was feeling so psychotic With the whole world excited for me and my idol saying I got it Shit got bad out in LA so I moved back home to my moms basement Linked up with Smoko and Papi Beatz and took it back to basics Then I wrote Rage that was me screaming out through the pain And U Mad addressing my relationship with Natalie it was too bad The violence and the lies slipped suicide into my mental health I did acid in the studio one day and almost killed myself As I started to fall apart certain stars started to align OmMas came to Chicago in January at the perfect time He said Kanye was working on an album and Uzi played him one of our songs He was tryna fly me out nigga it was goin down like the Dow Jones Pulled up to Westlake first day I was there I recorded Wolves I knew I was the one like Neo meeting with the Oracle But I had to get a handle fore the door was pulled Crawled out on SNL All the niggas hating on me back home lookin at me like FML A lot of people coming out the wood like Lets work tryna network All the pressure making my head hurt the molly wouldnt let the meds work At this time its like Feb 1st to the 15th and Im still addicted Frustrated writing shit for Ye tryna visualize someone elses vision Then he laid that verse on U Mad and we made the shit the single Ye and Hov getting into it over me tryna do a joint venture And GOOD Music still fam but its that Roc boy SAVEMONEY life Took the bus out on the road for the Traffic tour did a hundred nights Cleaned out my closet I got rid of all of my demons If you learn one thing from my journey nigga its dont stop believing When this shit got so suffocating I could barely even keep breathing Wrote my wrongs all in this song now Id like to welcome yall to my season Nigga Im gone  Know I never die We live forever in my mind And I sanctify We

poor gonna be so poor and hungry you know what Im saying its gonna be like there might be some cannibalism out this mutha they might eat the rich  Aight so let me ask you this then do you see yourself as somebody thats rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities  I see myself as a natural born hustler a true hustler in every sense of the word I took nothin I took the opportunities I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company I changed everything I realized my destiny in a matter of five years you know what Im saying I made myself a millionaire I made millions for a lot of people now its time to make millions for myself you know what Im saying I made millions for the record companies I made millions for these movie companies now I make millions for us  And through your different avenues of success how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity  By my faith in God by my faith in the game and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true You know what Im saying and it was happening to me for a reason you know what Im saying I was noticing shit I was punching the right buttons and it was happening So its no problem you know I mean its a problem but Im not finna let them know Im finna go straight through  Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall  Shit I like to think that at every opportunity Ive ever been threatened with resistance its been met with resistance And not only me but it goes down my family tree You know what Im saying its in my veins to fight back  Aight well how long you think it take before niggas be like we fighting a war Im fighting a war I cant win and I wanna lay it all down  In this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength and thats right now while you a teenager while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights while you still wanna shoot back Cause once you turn 30 its like they take the heart and soul out of a man out of a black man in this country And you dont wanna fight no more And if you dont believe me you can look around you dont see no loud mouth 30year old muthafuckas  Thats crazy because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind I can truly tell you that theres nothing but turmoil goin on so I wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today  I think that niggas is tired of grabbin shit out the stores and next time its a riot theres gonna be like uh bloodshed for real I dont think America know that I think American think we was just playing and its gonna be some more playing but it aint gonna be no playing Its gonna be murder you know what Im saying its gonna be like Nat Turner 1831 up in this muthafucka You know what Im saying its gonna happen  Thats crazy man In my opinion only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations lotta people dont understand how important it is Sometimes I be like get behind a mic and I dont know what type of energy Imma push out or where it comes from Trip me out sometimes  Because the spirits we aint even really rappin we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us  Damn I wanted to read one last thing to you Its actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world It says The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it in order to protect itself from this mad city While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him but praises the butterfly The butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him He can no longer see past his own thoughts Hes trapped When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take roots such as going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city The result Wings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant Finally free the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered ending the internal struggle Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different they are one and the same Whats your perspective on that Pac Pac Pac", 682], "0qGFnxDIqGBIq2D3zNbjk9": ["  Lord God I come to you a sinner And I humbly repent for my sins I believe that Jesus is Lord I

mommas pad Reality struck I seen the white car crash Hit the light pole two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed My pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him Security guard for a month and ended up leavin In fact I got fired cause I was inspired by all of my friends To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in Projects tore up gang signs get thrown up Cocaine laced in marijuana And they wonder why I rarely smoke now Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin at the mouth I was straight tweakin the next weekend we broke even I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin You know the reasons but still will never know my life Kendrick aka Comptons Human Sacrifice  Gyeah cocaine weed Niggas been mixin shit since the 80s loc Sherm sticks buttnakeds Dip make a nigga flip Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit One times crooked and shit Block a nigga in Alondra Rosecrans Bullis its Compton  Im still in the hood loc yeah thats cool Shit the hood took me under so I follow the rules But yeah thats like me I grew up in the hood where they bang And niggas that rep colors is doin the same thang Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me A couple drivebys in the hood lately Couple of IVs with the fuckin spraycan Shots in the crowd then everybody ran Crew Im finna slay the street life I crave Shots hit the enemy hearts turn brave Mount up regulators in the whip Down the boulevard with the pistol grip Trip we in the hood still So loc grab a strap cause yeah its so real Deal with the outcome a strap in the hand And a bird and ten grands where a mothafucka stand  If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen would you believe me Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat If I mentioned all of my skeletons would you jump in the seat Would you say my intelligence now is great relief And its safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep With dreams of bein a lawyer or doctor Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the culdesac hostage Kill em all if they gossip The Children of the Corn they vandalizin the option Of livin a lie drown their body with toxins Constantly drinkin and drive Hit the powder then watch this flame that arrive in his eye Listen coward the concept is aim and then bang it and slide Out that bitch with deposit a price on his head the tithes Probably go to the projects I Live inside the belly of the rough Compton USA Made Me an Angel on Angel Dust what  MAAd city Compton  Nigga pass Dot the bottle damn You aint the one that got fucked up What you holdin it for Niggas always actin unsensitive and shit Nigga that aint no word Nigga shut up Hey Dot you good my nigga Dont even trip Just lay back and drink that", 539],

and its my turn To settle down my main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me I said when the lights shut off and its my turn To settle down my main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me  I woke up this morning and figured Id call you In case Im not here tomorrow Im hopin that I can borrow A peace of mind Im behind on whats really important My mind is really distorted I find nothing but trouble in my life Im fortunate you believe in a dream This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine And last night was just another distraction Or a reaction of what we consider madness I know exactly what happened You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel Like everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up But the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will As blood spilled on your hands my plans rather vindictive Everybodys a victim in my eyes When I ride its a murderous rhythm And outside became pitch black A demon glued to my back whispering Get em I got em and I aint give a fuck That same mentality that told my brother not to duck In actuality its a trip how we trip off of colors I wonder if Ill ever discover a passion like you and recover The life that I knew as a youngin In pajamas and duntaduns When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs Dumb niggas like me never prosper Prognosis of a problem child Im proud and welldevoted This Piru shit been in me forever So forever Ima push it wherever whenever And I love you cause you love my brother like you did Just promise me youll tell this story when you make it big And if I die before your album drop I hope gunshots  Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me I said when the lights shut off and its my turn To settle down my main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me  You wrote a song about my sister on your tape And called it Section80 The message resembled Brendas Got a Baby Whats crazy was I was hearin about it But doubted your ignorance How could you ever just put her on blast and shit Judgin her past and shit Well its completely my future Her nigga behind me right now askin for ass and shit And Ima need that forty dollars Even if I got to fuck suck and swallow In the parking lot Gonzales Park Im followed By a married man and father of three My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin keys Matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with Es He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week This is the life of another girl damaged by the system These foster homes I run away and never do miss em See my hormones just run away and if I can get em Back to where they used to be then Ill probably be in the denim Of a family gene that show women how to be woman Or better yet a leader you need her to learn somethin Then you probably need to beat her thats how I was taught Three niggas in one room first time I was tossed And Im exhausted but fuck that Sorry for your loss shit My sister died in vain but what point are you tryna gain If you cant fit the pumps I walk in Ill wait Your rebuttal a little too late And if you have a album date just make sure Im not in the song Cause I dont need the attention bring enough of that on my own And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great A doctors approval is a waste of time I know Im straight Ill probably live longer than you and never fade away Ill never fade away Ill never fade away I know my fate And Im on the grind for this cake Ima get it or die tryin Im eyein every male gender with intentions of buyin You lyin to these motherfuckers Talkin about you can help em with my story You can help me if you sell this pussy for me nigga Dont ignore me nigga fuck your glory nigga you aint shit  When the lights shut off and its my turn To settle down my main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me I said when the lights shut off and its my turn To settle down my main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me  Sometimes I look in the mirror And ask myself Am I really scared of passing away If its today I hope I hear a Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon With the Holy Ghost til it drown in the blood of Jesus I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin The scent of a reaper ensuring that my allegiance With the other side may come soon And if Im doomed May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons I suffer a lot And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch I tie my stomach in knots And Im not sure why Im infatuated with death My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats That can come about Cause the tongue is mighty powerful And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch Maybe cause Im a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death Really stuck in the schema of wondering when Ima rest And youre right your brother was a brother to me And your sisters situation was the one that pulled me In a direction to speak on somethin Thats realer than the TV screen By any means wasnt trying to offend or come between Her personal life I was like It need to be told Cursing the life of twenty generations after her soul Exactly whatd happen if I aint continue rappin Or steady being distracted by money drugs and fourfives I count lives all on these songs Look at the weak and cry pray one day youll be strong Fighting for your rights even when youre wrong And hope that at least one of you Sing about me when Im gone Am I worth it Did I put enough work in  Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me I said when the lights shut off and its my turn To settle down my main concern Promise that you will sing about me Promise that you will sing about me  Promise that youll sing about me forever Promise that youll sing about me for ooooh Promise that youll sing about me forever Promise that youll sing about me for ooooh Promise that youll sing about me forever Promise that youll sing about me for ooooh

own kind but retiring nothing Tires are steady screeching the driver is rubbing Hands on the wheel who said we wasnt Dying of thirst dying of thirst dying of thirst  Dope on the corner Look at the coroner Daughter is dead mother is mourning her Stray bullets AK bullets Resuscitation was waiting patiently but they couldnt Bring her back who got the footage Channel 9 cameras is looking Its hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked Banana clip split his banana pudding Im like Tre thats Cuba Gooding I know Im good at Dying of thirst dying of thirst dying of thirst  How many sins Im running out How many sins I lost count Dreams of ballin like Spalding But only shotty bounce The reaper calling Im cottonmouth Money is power  Yours is ours  Lay with a snitch Die with a coward Hope we get rich Hope we can tower Over the city with vanity with the music louder The same song a black flower Ill show you how to Dye your thirst dye your thirst dye your thirst  What are we doing Who are we fooling Hell is hot Fire is proven To burn for eternity Return of the student That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it Tired of running Choirs is humming Tell us to visit We lie about coming Now back to business Loading the guns in Back of the Buick your hood is feuding The beef is bubbling Its no discussion Hereditary all of my cousins Dying of thirst dying of thirst dying of thirst  Too many sins Im running out Somebody send me a well for the drought See all I know is taking notes On taking this life for granted granted if he provoke My best days I stress days  My best days I stress days Say Fuck the world my sex slave Money pussy and greed  Whats my next crave Whatever it is know its my next grave Tired of running tired of running tired of tumbling Tired of running tired of tumbling  backwards My momma say See a pastor give me a promise What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished The truth will set you free so to me be completely honest You dying of thirst you dying of thirst So hop in that water and pray that it works  Fuck Im tired of this shit Im tired of fuckin runnin Im tired of this shit Thats my brother homie Young man come talk to me Is that what I think that is I know thats not what I think that is Why are you so angry See you young men are dying of thirst Do you know what that means That means you need water holy water You need to be baptized with the spirit of the Lord Do you want to receive God as your personal savior Okay repeat after me Lord God I come to You a sinner  And I humbly repent for my sins  I believe that Jesus is Lord  I believe you raised Him from the dead  I would ask that Jesus come into my life  And to be my Lord and Savior  I receive Jesus to take control of my life  And that I may live with Him from this day forward  Thank you Lord Jesus For saving me with Your precious blood  In Jesus name amen  Alright now remember this day The start of a new life  your REAL life", 709],

nothing but trouble in my life Im fortunate you believe in a dream This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine And last night was just another distraction Or a reaction of what we consider madness I know exactly what happened You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel Like everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up But the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will As blood spilled on your hands my plans rather vindictive Everybodys a victim in my eyes When I ride its a murderous rhythm And outside became pitch black A demon glued to my back whispering Get em I got em and I aint give a fuck That same mentality that told my brother not to duck In actuality its a trip how we trip off of colors I wonder if Ill ever discover a passion like you and recover The life that I knew as a youngin In pajamas and duntaduns When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs Dumb niggas like me never prosper

father of three My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin keys Matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with Es He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week This is the life of

you treating my momma like she your momma too Why you making promises that youll forever do Whatever just to make me happy wanting us to have a family These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you

there  And so she said Why you gotta be so mean to me Why you dont know what you mean to me Why you always playing games Why I feel like you ashamed Out in public curse me out and make a scenery Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me Why text messages popping up saying Hi Daddy Why you treat me like Im nothing Why you always at a function I be wanting to go out but you dont ever ask me Why you slip and say her name when we having sex Why you always assuming that I still love my ex Everytime we get into it Im the one thats feeling stupid You dont need me you gon leave me thats ya favorite threat Why you never know how it feel to be lonely Why I feel Im the last option after ya homies Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go Even tho you get violent and put your hands on me    She says she loves me She says she loves me So she clings to me even when I want to be left alone But shes beautiful Like sometimes when I have things on my mindshes the perfect person to listen And she only gives advice She says she loves me And she only gives advice She says she loves me Like when I wake up in the morning shes sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food wanting to feed me She says she needs me She says she loves me Or like when Im stepping out of the shower shes standing there with the towel wanting to wanting to dry me off She says she says she loves me So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake She says she loves me and I dont know about love", 229], "1oH44ACGSLbJGcbw2JLQOt": ["  I used to want to be like Michael Jordan
